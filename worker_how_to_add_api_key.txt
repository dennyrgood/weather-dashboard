Instructions for Deployment

    Update the Worker: Replace the contents of your existing worker.js with the code above and deploy it to Cloudflare.

    Set the Secret Key: After receiving your key from Open-Meteo, go to the Settings > 

               Environment Variables section of your worker in the Cloudflare Dashboard and add a new secret named:



        Variable Name: OPENMETEO_API_KEY

        Variable Value: [Paste your Open-Meteo key here]



The worker will now check for that key. If it exists, it will automatically append it to the Open-Meteo URL, 

        resolving the rate-limiting issue without exposing the key in the code.
